            <p>Rex Wells, the owner of Wells Pools has been building <a href="pools.html">swimming pools</a> for over 20 years. Unlike other pool companies that say they are &quot;<strong>family owned</strong>&quot;, Wells is not only family owned, but family operated as well. Rex is acting construction manager on every pool project  and is on-site for every major phase of construction. Rex's nephew Joel is Wells Pools' expert designer and sales manager. And you can find Rex's wife Kim running the office, handling customer service and keeping the boys (and your project) on schedule! </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We pride ourselves on our ability to work closely with our customers to create the professionally designed pool of their choice and to provide the best value we can.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We have established a solid reputation of building pools as quickly and efficiently as our top quality standards will allow; No one builds a stronger, more durable pool than Wells Pools, which is why our construction and equipment warranties are among the finest in the industry.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Our commitment to quality and customer satisfaction is the number one reason nearly all of our customers are referred to us by either satisfied Wells Pools owners or professionals in the pool industry who respect our work.</p>
